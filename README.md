RootCloak
==========

This is a module for Xposed Framework.
This allows you to run apps that detect root without disabling root. You select from a list of your installed apps (or add a custom entry), and using a variety of methods, it will completely hide root from that app. This includes hiding the su binary, superuser/supersu apks, processes run by root, and more.

Requires:
-Xposed Framework v2.4.1 (with XposedBridge v42)
-Root (otherwise why use this?)

Instructions:

1. Have Xposed Framework installed.
2. Install RootCloak.
3. Enable RootCloak in the Xposed app, in the Modules section.
4. Reboot your phone.
5. Open RootClock settings, go to Add/Remove Apps, and under the menu, press Reset to Default Apps.
6. If the app you want to hide root from is not in the list, you must then press the + to add it.
7. Exit RootCloak settings. If the app you just added to the list was already running, you need to FORCE CLOSE it for the settings to take effect.
8. Run the app to see if root was successfully hidden.
